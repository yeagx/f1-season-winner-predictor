# f1-season-winner-predictor
This project is a machine-learning web app that predicts the Formula 1 season winner using race-level and driver-level data. The app allows users to upload an Excel dataset (containing race results, standings, wins, and race winners), then processes the data and trains an XGBoost model to predict the season champion.
